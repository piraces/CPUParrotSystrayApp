# CPUParrotSystrayApp

CPUParrotSystrayApp is a simple PoC Systray app for Windows, made in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), which its only purpose is to show the current CPU Usage (when hovering the icon) and to animate the parrot icon based on the usage (more speed => more CPU).

Frames used in the icon extracted from the ["Cult of the Party Parrot"]([https://cultofthepartyparrot.com/](https://cultofthepartyparrot.com/)) website.
